# Welcome to grit

## What is grit?

grit is a scientific research data management platform. In the grit platform you can store, manage, and visualise data from all the pre-clinical drug discovery phases.

Learn more and read the docs [here](https://grit42.github.io/grit/intro).

## Getting started

The easiest way to start using grit is to use the docker compose configuration and guide found in the [starter repo](https://github.com/grit42/grit-starter).

## Machine Requirements

grit has been shown to run smoothly on modest hardware such as [Hetzner CPX21](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) with over 200 millions data points. Modern laptops should have no problem running grit for evaluation purposes.

Indicative requirements:
- 2 vCPUs @ 3 GHz
- 4 GB RAM
- 40 GB storage
