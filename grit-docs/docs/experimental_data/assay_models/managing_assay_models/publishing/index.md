# Publishing Assay Models Metadata

**Assay Models** must be published before they can be used to create **Experiments** and record experimental data.

Once published, an **Assay Model** cannot be modified to ensure integrity of already loaded data.

A published **Assay Model** can be converted back to draft with the effect of deleting all its **Experiments**. A confirmation is required before the **Assay Model** is converted to draft and **Experiments** are deleted.
:::danger
Deleted **Experiments** cannot be recovered. Exercise caution when converting an **Assay Model** to draft.
:::

An **Assay Model** can be cloned at any point to create a new version of it that can be modified at will.
