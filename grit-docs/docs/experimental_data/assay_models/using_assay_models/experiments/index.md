# Experiments

The **Experiments** tab of an **Assay Model** displays the list of its **Experiments**.

An **Experiment** can be opened by clicking a row in the table, and new **Experiments** can be created by clicking the **New** button above the table.

The list displays the values for **Metadata Definitions** and can be filtered.
