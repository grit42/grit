# Experimental Data

grit is built around the storage, retrieval and visualisation of structured experimental data and metadata. **Vocabularies** and **Metadata Definitions** capture the contextual information that describes your work, while **Assay Models** define the structure of your data sets. Data and metadata is recorded in **Experiments** and can be explored through **Data Tables**.
