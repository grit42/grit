# Experiments

**Experiments** are containers for experimental data sets. They hold a data set and metadata according to the requirements of the **Assay Model** they belong to.

Experimental data can be record manually, or loaded in bulk from a spreadsheet or delimiter-separated file.

Once recorded, experiment data can be visualised in plots.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
