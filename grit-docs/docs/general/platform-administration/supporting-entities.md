# Supporting Entities

grit features a small set of entities that support user and data management. These entities are managed by _Administrators_ in the **Administration** section under the **General** tab.

## Origins

_Origins_ represent sources of data. An _Origin_ could be a department, an external partner (e.g. a CRO), or an acquired company. _Origins_ are required in some parts of the system, most notably in _Users_ and _Load Sets_.

## Locations

_Locations_ represent physical places that _Users_ or data may be linked to. A _Location_ requires an _Origin_, and multiple _Locations_ can share the same _Origin_.

## Units

_Units_ provide a controlled list of relevant measurement units for use as metadata throughout the system, such as in _Compound Properties_ or _Assay Data Sheet Columns_. _Units_ can be added, modified, and removed as needed.
