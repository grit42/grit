# Importing data

grit offers a consistent data upload experience across most parts of the system. The import process follows a standardised sequence of steps, typically requiring the same user inputs regardless of context. Uploaded data is expected to be in a delimiter-separated format (such as CSV or TSV) with headers or in supported specialised formats, where applicable. In some cases, additional information may be required, but these requirements are clearly indicated and often pre-filled to ensure a smooth and transparent experience.

Imported data sets are referred to as **Load Sets**. A Load Set can be undone to remove all associated data from the system, provided the data is not linked to other entities.

When a view supports data import, the _Import_ toolbar action will be enabled. The import flow is started by clicking the _Import_ toolbar action. Some views may support importing different kind of data, requiring choosing the appropriate data type in a menu before continuing.

## Uploading a Data Set

The first step in the import process prompts to provide a text-based data set along with metadata describing the content to be imported.

![Load set creation form](./assets/import_form.png)

1.  The name of the Load Set. This is pre-filled based on the data type and the current date, but it is recommended to provide a more meaningful name for future reference.
2.  The _Origin_ of the data. This helps track where the source of the data set.
3.  The separator used in the data set. When a file is added, the system attempts to detect the delimiter based on the file's contents.
4.  A field specific to the kind of data being uploaded. Here, the format of the molecular structures in the file.
5.  A field specific to the kind of data being uploaded. Here, the compound type.
6.  The data set itself. A data set can be added by:
  -  dropping a file in the dark upload area
  -  opening the file explorer and selecting a file
  -  clicking the dark area and manually typing or pasting a selection from a spreadsheet or another text editor

:::tip
Copying a selection in most spreadsheet applications will produce delimiter-separated text, which can be pasted directly into the input area.
:::

When all fields have been filled and a data set has been added, click on the **Start import** above the data set to continue.

## Mapping the Data Set

The second step in the import process consists of mapping columns from the data set to properties in the system.

![Mapping columns to properties](../compounds/assets/compound_reg_import_mapping.png)

1.  A preview of the data set
2.  The form to map data set column to properties in grit

There are two categories of properties: **simple properties** and **entity properties**.
Simple properties, such as numbers, text, dates, and booleans, only need to be mapped to a column in the data set.
Entity properties refer to more complex data types, such as Units or Origins. Like simple properties, they must be mapped to a column in the data set, but they also require a unique field to identify the corresponding record in the database using the value from the data set.

There may be cases where a property does not have a corresponding column in the data set. If the missing property has the same value for all records, you can specify a default value to be applied uniformly. However, if the value varies between records, the data set should be updated accordingly, or the import should be cancelled and restarted with a complete data set.

:::tip
Data set columns with headers matching property names will be mapped automatically.
:::

### Mapping a simple property

To map a simple property to a column, select the appropriate column from the dropdown menu under the property name in the form on the left.

### Mapping an entity property

To map an entity property to a column, first select the appropriate column from the dropdown menu under the property name in the form on the left. Then, use the dropdown menu labelled _Find by_ to choose the entity property that should be used to match the record based on the value in the data set.

:::info
Only unique properties show up in the _Find by_ menu to ensure the correct record is resolved.
:::

### Using a constant value

To use a constant value, enable the switch labelled _Use a constant value_ located below the propertyâ€™s dropdown menu. This will replace the dropdown with an input field where a default value can be entered.

![Mapping form with constant value switch highlighted](./assets/mapping_property_constant_value.png)

1.  A property mapped to a data set column
2.  A property set to a constant value

## Validating the Data Set

The third step in the import process is validation. Once all required properties have been configured, the data set can be validated by clicking the **Validate Data Set** button.

:::info
Depending on system load and the size of the data set, the validation process may take some time.
:::

![Mapped data set with validate button highlighted](./assets/validate_data_set.png)

If the data set contains errors (such as missing or incorrectly formatted values, unresolved entities, or conflicting unique constraints) or warnings, additional tabs will appear next to the _Data Set Preview_ tab, showing:

* A detailed list of all errors
* All rows that produced errors
* A detailed list of all warnings

These list can be exported as CSV files for further processing by clicking the _Export_ toolbar action in the relevant tab.

![Validation failed with tabs and export highlighted](./assets/import_validation_failed.png)

There are three ways to address errors in a data set:

1. Update the data set
  * Clicking this button will reveal a text editor where you can manually edit the data or replace the file
2. Cancel the import and start over with a clean data set
3. Ignore records with errors and proceed with the valid ones

![Validation failed with actions highlighted](./assets/import_validation_failed_actions.png)

If the data set is free of errors, the property mapping form will be locked, allowing you to review the mappings before confirming.

## Reviewing the Loaded Data

The final step in the import process is reviewing the imported records.
After confirming a valid Load Set or choosing to proceed with only valid records from an invalid one, the imported data will be displayed in a grid that can be filtered and sorted for inspection.

Specific actions may be available in this view depending on the type of data imported.

![Successful import with actions highlighted](./assets/successful_import_actions.png)

## Deleting all records created by a Load Set

All records from a **Load Set** can be deleted by clicking **Undo Import** in the final step of the import process, provided none of the records are in use elsewhere in the system. Undoing an import restarts the process at the mapping step, including any previously ignored rows, allowing mappings and data to be modified as needed. The data set will undergo validation again even if no modifications were made.

### Finding Load Sets

A list of **Load Sets** for a given type of data can usually be found close to the view where the import process was started. Click a Load Set in the list to open the importer and continue mapping, edit the data set or undo the import.<br />
The management of _Locations_ in the system is done in the **Administration** section. All related **Load Sets** can be found in the tab next to the list of _Locations_.
