# Vocabularies

The **Vocabularies** feature enables users to define and manage controlled lists of values. These vocabularies ensure consistent and standardized data entry across the platform, facilitating accurate downstream analysis and interoperability.

Vocabularies can be linked to data fields during data capture. By restricting values to a predefined set, vocabularies:

* Reduce data entry errors
* Ensure semantic consistency across datasets
* Support alignment with institutional or domain-specific standards (e.g., ontologies or regulatory taxonomies)
* Support the creation and storage of high-quality, interoperable datasets aligned with FAIR data principles

Vocabularies can be reused across forms and studies, making them a powerful tool for enforcing data quality in collaborative and longitudinal research.

## Key Concepts

* **Vocabulary**: A named list of permitted values. Each vocabulary may optionally include a description
* **Vocabulary Item**: An individual entry in a vocabulary, optionally including a description
* **Field Binding**: A data capture field (e.g., in a form or assay metadata) can be bound to a vocabulary, restricting its input to valid terms.
