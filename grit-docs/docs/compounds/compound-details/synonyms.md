# Compound synonyms

When compounds are registered in the grit platform they are automatically assigned a grit compound number (e.g. GRIT0000856) by the system 1). Most compounds already have a name assigned to it by the producer (e.g.DB04879) which we normally add to the name column 2) in order to keep a reference in grit to the producer (origin) of the compound.

In some cases compounds are known by more than one name. Apart from the original producer these can arise from acquisitions, database collections or, in case of some often used standard compounds, they are simply nicknames.

In the grit platform we call the extra names "synonyms". And the compounds can be assigned as many synonyms as needed 1). To add new synonyms simply click the New synonyms button 2)

By default the grit compound number as well as the compound name is displayed in the compounds grid. But you can still use the synonym names in the filter as input for searches.

1. Open the filter and look for the synonym name in the name column (there's no synonym column in the compounds grid)
2. Add a relevant operator and one of the synonym names
3. The synonym name used in the filter will now be displayed in the name column in the result set
