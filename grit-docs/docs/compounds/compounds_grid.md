# Compounds grid

The Compounds grid shows the modalities currently in the database at the compounds/structure level. This grid can be filtered and sorted as
described in the [Data grids](/general/data-grids), including by structure if available. By default, the Compounds grid shows all columns
of all compound types, and columns belonging to the same compound types are grouped.

Above the grid is a selector used to display only a subset of all compounds based on their type. Using this selector will filter the compounds displayed in the list, as well as the columns visible.

The compound types can be found in the Compounds grid in two places as shown in the screenshot above:

1. As quick filters over the grid
2. As a separate column in the grid in the individual compound row

The quick filters above the Compounds grid 1) can also be used to filter the compounds. Here we have selected two of the three compounds types and we therefore only see 2) the compound type-specific columns relevant for these compound types.
