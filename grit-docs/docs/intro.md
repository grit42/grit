# What is grit?

grit is a scientific research data management platform for storing, managing, and visualizing data from all preclinical drug discovery phases.

In grit, you can store various modalities—such as small molecules, oligonucleotides, and antibodies—alongside preclinical assay data from in vitro, in vivo, DMPK, and toxicology studies (including SEND format).

Administrators can configure which metadata (columns) to store for each modality. You can define multiple compound types and specify relevant metadata for compounds and their batches, allowing different modalities to coexist within grit.

Once registered, modalities can be linked to in silico or in vitro assays and animal models. Experimental results are uploaded under the corresponding assays and connected to the relevant modality for streamlined data management.
