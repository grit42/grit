# Introduction

## What is grit?

grit is a Scientific Data Management System (SDMS) designed for preclinical drug discovery.<br />
It provides structured storage for experimental data—including, but not limited to, results from in vitro, in vivo, DMPK, and toxicology studies—alongside metadata for therapeutic modalities such as small molecules, oligonucleotides, and antibodies.

grit enables the creation and management of high-quality datasets with configurable metadata through intuitive forms and a robust import process. It features full ontology support and strict data validation. Administrators define the data structure, allowing scientists and data managers to enter information quickly and confidently, ensuring consistency and interoperability

### Therapeutic modalities

grit enables registration of a wide range of therapeutics modalities, referred to as **Compounds**, and optionally **Batches** in a single place. Define **Compound Types** and **Compound Properties**, and start registering small molecules (including structures), oligonucleotides, or anything you research with simple forms and a strictly validated data upload process. Information about registered modalities is easy to find with filtering and sorting.

### Experimental data

grit makes managing structured experimental data a breeze. **Assay Types** enable grouping data sets in broad categories, **Assay Models** define the shape of your experimental data and associated metadata, **Assays** provide an umbrella for directly comparable data sets and **Experiments** store your results. Results can be entered manually with simple forms and in bulk via a strictly validated data upload process. Results can be visualised in plots.

### Ontologies

grit fully supports Ontologies for high quality, consistent and interoperable data. **Vocabularies** provide lists of controlled terms that can be used as data source for **Compound Properties** and data points in **Experiments**.

### Security and user management

grit features Role-Based Access Control and optional two-factor authentication. Data is stored securely and accessible only by authorized users.
