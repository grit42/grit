# Assay Models

[Assay Models](./managing_assay_models/index.md) define the blueprint for how experimental data should be recorded. Each assay model is tailored to a particular experimental approach and includes both a set of [metadata fields](./managing_assay_models/metadata.md) and one or more [data sheets](./managing_assay_models/data_sheets/index.md).

Assay Models are grouped in [Assay Types](./assay_types.md).

The metadata fields capture essential contextual information—such as organism, target class, or readout type—and are linked to controlled [vocabularies](../vocabularies/index.md) to ensure standardized terminology.

The data sheets specified in the assay model define the structure of the experimental data to be collected. This includes the column names, expected data types, and standardized units, ensuring that results are captured in a consistent and interpretable format.
