# Assay types


Assay types is basically a grouping of similar assays (in vitro and in vivo etc) and hence a way to filter the assays based on group/area they belong to as can be seen from the main Assays overview.

Selecting the "Plate based in vitro" assay type results in no assay models and assays.

Whereas selecting the "in vitro" assay type at the top show the available assay model.

Adding new assay types is very easy (NOTE: But does require admin rights):

1) Go to the Administration menu
2) Select Assays tab
3) Select Types
4) Click the New button and add Name and potentially a Description in the appearing form
