# Assay models

Assay models are the templates for the assays. The assay models are linked to an assay type and contains
some details, potentially controlled metadata fields and one or several data sheets with plot(s). The data sheets are data reporting forms, hence they define format of the data - the columns - you will be uploading as results from the experiments under the assay.

The assay models are stored under Administration -> Assays -> Models.

The Assay models overview also show what assay type the model is linked to 3) and what the current status is 4).

1) Details
2) Metadata
3) Data sheets
