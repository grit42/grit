      First step is to create relevant assay types (groups like in vitro, in vivo or what fits your area)) followed by defining
      the assay models (templates) you need. This could as an example be a standard in vivo infection model. The assays run under
      that in vivo infection model could then be one using rats and another using mice. Hence, two different assays(versions) of the
      infection assay model."
