# Vocabularies

Vocabularies enable platform wide controlled terms and their accepted values. The vocabularies are a prerequisite for adding
controlled [assay metadata](../setting-up/assay_metadata.md) to the assay models.

To add new controlled terms to the grit vocabulary go to:

1) Administration
2) Vocabularies
3) Click the "+ New vocabulary" or "New" button
4) Add a name and a description

**Note**: Needless to say. The name used for a vocabulary entry is important as that will become *the* controlled and accepted term in the grit platform.
